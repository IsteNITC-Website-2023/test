                        Currently, in electronics, one hot topic steadily gathering engineers' interest worldwide is
                        Quantum Dots (or QDs in short).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong></strong>
                        So, what exactly do you mean by Quantum Dots?
                    </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum Dots refer to semiconductor particles only a few nanometers in size. Due to their small
                        size, these particles fall under the domain of quantum mechanics and are subject to the
                        properties of the Quantum Realm. This makes quantum dots have properties different from bulk
                        semiconductors and closer to individual atoms/molecules. These properties can be used to create
                        new amazing devices, which can bring about a lot of new possibilities. (Who knows, it may help
                        make that cool Iron Man suit from Avengers: Infinity War!)
                    </p>

                    <strong>
                        Quantum dots and Nanotechnology:
                    </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum dots are considered to be the building blocks of nanotechnology. They are based on the
                        property that electron transition can either release or consume energy in the form of light.
                        Quantum dots have optical and electrical properties that depend on the particles’ size, shape,
                        and composition. Large QDs (5–6 nm diameter) emit longer wavelengths, with colors like orange,
                        red or yellow. Smaller QDs (2–3 nm diameter) emit shorter wavelengths, giving colors like blue,
                        green, and violet.
                    </p>

                        Many researchers around the globe are trying to make use of Quantum dots to make conventional
                        electronic devices such as single-electron transistors, solar cells, LEDs, and lasers. One major
                        application of Quantum dots in consumer electronics came from Samsung in 2017 with its
                        introduction of the Quantum Dot LED TV (or QLED TV) range. These are LCD-based TVs augmented
                        with quantum dot nanocrystals. They provided a viewing resolution of 4K and 8K and were highly
                        praised for their viewing quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than electronics, Quantum Dots has shown numerous applications in biology. They are used
                        in modern biological analysis to detect different molecules in the body. Quantum dots can also
                        be used for antibacterial purposes. Single-molecule tracking experiments are possible as well
                        because of current developments in the field.

                    </p>
                    <p>



                        However, one application of Quantum Dots that can have immense potential is the Quantum Field
                        Effect Transistor (QFET).

                    <strong>
                        The Quantum Field Effect Transistor (QFET)
                    </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For many years, transistors have been used in everyday life for a lot more purposes than we can
                        imagine. In modern-day computers, ranging from supercomputers to even your newly-bought
                        smartphone, transistors are everywhere. Currently, an average computer circuit consists of more
                        than a billion transistors, and it’s still growing. However, here’s the catch: as the number of
                        transistors increase, the size of the transistors decreases at the same rate. The size of a
                        transistor is currently at 7 nm (about 7/1,000,000th of a millimeter.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles
                        every two years. However, since the year 2010, the observations in the industry have been
                        slightly less than the predicted value. This is because as of now, we are reaching a physical
                        limit for downsizing transistors and Moore’s Law may be invalid in the next few decades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a situation like this, Quantum dots may have great potential for faster devices because using
                        this, it might be possible to achieve even smaller transistors. Currently, numerous efforts are
                        being made to design field effect transistors (FETs) using Quantum Dots, which can additionally
                        increase the speed of the charge carriers (like electrons and holes) by a factor of 3000.

                    <strong>

                        So, what next??
                    </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum dots is still a developing field, with many facts about the subject still being unknown
                        or uncertain. But new applications and discoveries in the field are coming up every day, with
                        each being more fascinating than before. As this topic continues to create ripples in the world
                        of science, many believe that Quantum Dots can pave the way for the future of electronics.
