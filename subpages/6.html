                        “Outrageous” “Absolute and utter rubbish” “ dangerous nonsense”- Just some of the imaginative
                        words used by officials of and by the UK government to describe what can be called the second
                        most horrible pandemic after the coronavirus. Conspiracy theories -voted “definitely true” by
                        absolutely no one have been the bane of organizations worldwide trying to make sense of the
                        global threat that has consumed us for the past two years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the WHO chief calling out the infodemic to be more devastating than the actual pandemic,
                        it’s important that we get to the bottom of these wildly crazy ideas being churned out by the
                        conspiracy theorists. The wildest thing about baseless theories is that they’re barely part of
                        the story-they’re just the latest headline. With technology making it easier for people to
                        engage in bad research and spread it more widely than ever before, it’s not surprising that
                        fake, cooked up stories are gaining popularity over the years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the more popular theories is that the coronavirus was in fact a bioweapon developed for
                        biological warfare. An idea that has spread so much that we might have heard them ourselves
                        quite often. There are claims of a lab leak in a “particular” country or the monkeys being
                        experimented on escaped, when a truck transporting them collided with a dumpster on a highway.
                        There could not have been a more dramatic way for lab monkeys to escape and start a global
                        pandemic. It gives - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a new meaning.

                        The easiest victim for the conspiracy theorists was the rollout of 5G. With these two global
                        phenomena happening simultaneously, the speculation about the link between them was quite
                        natural. Radio waves spread computer viruses. Not biological viruses. The theory got so much
                        traction that widespread destruction of the 5G infrastructure was reported at multiple locations
                        worldwide. Quite ironically, one of the protesters spit on a London network engineer who was
                        later believed to have contracted the coronavirus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another such crazy idea revolves around our friendly neighborhood Microsoft guy- Bill Gates. All
                        the billionaire did was fund a global vaccine research out of public goodwill and what he got in
                        return was a custom curated theory on his secret goals to control the world through microchips
                        in the vaccine. Quite the - Thank you Mr.Gates for your contribution. Here’s a theory on how we
                        think you are the evil Lord trying to create your own ‘Storm troopers’ via the vaccines.
                    </p>
                    <p>


                        These theories are just the tip of the iceberg. Given the nature of the problems that the world
                        is battling today, such beliefs are extremely disastrous and dangerous as they take the
                        spotlight away from actual concerns that need to be addressed. The crux of a conspiracy theory
                        is that it appeals to the human tendency to believe that huge and era-defining events need to
                        have a much bigger dramatic cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s good to know that multiple social media platforms are doing their fair bit to limit the
                        damage. However it’s impossible for them to regulate the amount of content coming out of them.
                        It is up to us to look beyond the imaginatively creative theories and examine them to ascertain
                        its factualness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simple questions like - is there a plausible reason , has it been in line with the
                        scientific evidence , and how practical is this- can allow us to separate reality from fiction.
                        Given the enormity of the situation , there’s a pressing need for us to become “truth
                        detectives” and try to sort propaganda from reality. Despite everything ,the credit goes out for
                        the person who came up with the monkey theory . It’s simply ingenious.
