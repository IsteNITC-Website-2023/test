                    <p>
                        Have you ever imagined that ants could help us solve traffic issues? You must have seen ants
                        traveling in lines, but in opposite directions. They can be compared to the traffic in the
                        highway
                        lanes. As we progress into the development of autonomous vehicles, learning how the ant
                        columns move can provide a potential solution to improve traffic. Here, we try to copy or mimic
                        the ants to solve our problem. This is what biomimicry is all about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To explain briefly, biomimicry is the imitation of models, systems and elements of nature to
                        solve
                        intricate human problems. The world has gone through evolution for millions of years and
                        created many incredible things in nature. Various species with different features and traits
                        have
                        developed. Biomimicry, or biomimetics, takes inspiration from these things to make life easier
                        for
                        humans.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why biomimicry?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our nature has innate potential and the number of features that can be emulated is vast
                        because of the complexity and diversity of the nature. Biomimicry helps to develop commercially
                        usable technologies, which at the same time, are regenerative and sustainable. Nature as
                        mentor stresses a new way of viewing our environment- breaking away from the industrialized
                        view of the world as a collection of resources available for plundering.
                    </p>
                    <h3> The three elements of biomimicry :</h3>
                    <p>
                        The practice of translating nature's strategies into design consists of three essential
                        elements.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> 1. Emulate : The methodical, scientific approach of studying and then modeling the shapes,
                            functions, and ecosystems of nature in order to produce more regenerative designs.</li>
                        <li>2. Ethos : The idea that life functions best when understood and used to inform the design
                            of
                            environments that sustain and foster life.</li>
                        <li> 3. Reconnect : The idea that we are a part of nature and that it is important to
                            acknowledge our
                            position as a component of the interdependent systems of life on Earth. Reconnecting with
                            nature helps us better grasp how life functions by encouraging us to spend time there and
                            watch
                            it. This will give us a better understanding of how to mimic biological tactics in our
                            designs.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Biomimicry as a process has two approaches. Sometimes, an innovator links an existing
                        technology to a process they observe in nature. On other occasions, he researches an issue
                        and looks to nature for assistance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Examples of biomimicry :</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Right from the time of early man when humans picked up hunting, shelter and survival
                            skills by watching animals, biomimicry has always been an inspiration for humans to
                            develop new technologies.
                        </li>
                        <li>Thepopular Velcro fastening is a bio inspired technology. In 1941, when George de
                            Mestral was walking his dog, he found that burrs were sticking to both of them. When he
                            examined under magnification, he discovered that hundreds of tiny hooks were
                            attributed to their sticking ability. This led to the invention of Velcro fasteners.
                        </li>
                        <li> Insulation from down feathers: Thick winter coats packed with down or other feathers
                            keep us warm.
                        </li>
                        <li> Termite mound cooling: Architects have been motivated to create more energy-efficient
                            structures by the way these tiny insects burrow tunnels in their mounds to escape the
                            heat of the African Savannah.
                        </li>
                        <li> Whalewind turbines: The ridges on humpback whales' pectoral fins produce an
                            aerodynamic flow in the water. They influenced the design of wind turbine blades.
                        </li>
                        <li> Beetle water collection: Although the dung beetle is more well-known for its
                            characteristics, it can also gather fog on its shell and bring it to its mouth in dry
                            climates
                            to drink. This has motivated scientists to investigate methods for extracting fresh water
                            from fog or dew.
                        </li>
                        <li> Glasswith a spiderweb pattern: One of nature's most resilient designs is the spiderweb.
                            The car industry has imitated the webbing pattern to prevent windshields from shattering
                            even while they crack.
                        </li>
                        <li> Locusts use highly evolved eyes that allow them to look in multiple directions at once to
                            avoid bumping into each other in swarms. While creating sensors that identify movement
                            immediately surrounding an automobile and alert drivers to approaching collisions, auto
                            designers took inspiration from the locusts' vision.
                        </li>
                        <li> Despite living in muddy ponds and swamps, Lotus plants maintain tidy leaves. The
                            microscopic bumps and ridges on the leaves prevent additional particles and water
                            molecules from transferring over the surface. Because of this, the water beading up and
                            sliding off takes dirt particles with it. Paint has been given this lotus look by
                            developers.
                            Tiny bumps that are left on the surface when the paint dries aid in the removal of dirt by
                            water droplets.
                        </li>
                        <li> Certain air conditioning systems use biomimicry in their fans to boost airflow while using
                            less energy. NASA and other companies have been working on creating swarm-style
                            space drones that are modeled after the behavior of bees and oxtapod terrestrial drones
                            that are modeled after desert spiders.
                        </li>
                        <li> Electrical devices that mimic the form and function of organic neurons are known as
                            neuromorphic computers and sensors. One example is the event camera, where only
                            the pixels that receive a new signal are updated to a new state. Until a signal is received,
                            no other pixel is updated.
                        </li>
                        <li> Viral capsules can be used to create a variety of nanodevice components, such as
                            nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Due to the charged surfaces on the inner and
                            outer layers of tubular viruses, like the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), crystal growth can
                            be nucleated. These particles can be used as building blocks to create nanotubes and
                            nanofibers.
                        </li>
                        <li> Research has been done on the moth's eye's light refractive characteristics to lower
                            solar panel reflectivity.
                        </li>
                        <li> ASwedishbusiness created a "micro mist" spray technology inspired by the Bombardier
                            beetle's potent repellent spray, which is said to have a low carbon impact.
                        </li>
                        <li> Theaerodynamics of streamlined design of the improved Japanese high speed train
                            Shinkansen 500 Series were modeled after the beak of the Kingfisher bird.
                        </li>
                        <li> Somebiorobots are made, inspired by the physiology and methods of locomotion of
                            animals. Examples include BionicKangaroo (which moves like a kangaroo, saving
                            energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump), Kamigami Robots (a children's
                            toy, mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor
                            surfaces) and Pleobot (a shrimp-inspired robot to study metachronal swimming and the
                            ecological impacts of this propulsive gait on the environment).
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Biomimicry is a method that draws inspiration from natural organisms and processes rather than
                        being a product in and of itself. The goal of biomimicry is to value nature for its lessons rather
                        than for what it may be used to extract, gather, or domesticate. Through this process, we
                        discover more about who we are, what drives us, and how we relate to one another and the
                        planet. As we go deeper into the realms of biomimicry, it becomes evident that nature has the
                        answers to some of the biggest issues of human world. Not only does learning about the natural
                        world allow us to innovate and advance, but it also increases our appreciation of the wonders
                        that surround us. Biomimicry is a tribute to nature's creative spirit and the limitless inspiration it
                        provides for a sustainable and peaceful future.
