                    The dawn of every century ushers in a new era of possibilities. Most of such possibilities might
                    seem impossible by virtue of the limitations of existing science or by the magnitude of their use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Never could the dreamers and the tinkerers of the 19th century predict the storm of discoveries
                        in
                        the early 1900s that would threaten to uproot their fundamental understanding of the universe.
                        They
                        were quite satisfied with what they had seemed to uncover and believed that nothing more was
                        left.
                        But just within the matter of a few years, our understanding of the world was changed in
                        unimaginable ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, we stand at the very cusp of such a revolution that could potentially allow us to
                        transcend
                        to the ultimate beings. Hints of the very same could be heard in the whisperings of the late
                        1900s.
                        Quantum technology, as it is called, is simply bizarre, exciting and more importantly
                        mysterious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A completely counterintuitive concept that defies logic, quantum tech has the power to impact
                        the
                        world in such a way that it can be compared to the emergence of a God or an all-powerful entity.
                        The
                        world we live in is deep rooted in its belief of cause and effect with the former preceding the
                        latter. All such notions are completely upended in the quantum world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every fantasy, be it time travel, the ultimate machine, teleportation, and multi-versal
                        operations
                        seem possible when the full power of quantum tech is realized. With the increase in its
                        popularity
                        over the recent years it’s worthwhile to explore the avenues that could open up and question
                        what it
                        would mean for us. So, let’s dive into the speculations about the quantum future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps, the most glamorous allure is the predicted possibility of teleportation. Quantum
                        teleportation in its basic sense is wormhole connections in the quantum foam. Before we get
                        excited
                        about the notion of vanishing from one place or time and appearing in another, it’s important to
                        note that it’s not what the theory says is possible. A fax machine can only transmit the data of
                        the
                        sheet which is then used to reconstruct it at the other end. Similarly, a Quantum teleportation
                        vessel can only compress an entire object into a stream of electrons and transmit it across the
                        ripples in space time. There still remains the issue of how to reconstruct such data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A world without diseases is a dream for many. The way to achieve it remains in the dark. With
                        the
                        operational complexity and the power of quantum computers, it seems like a trivial issue to
                        devise a
                        viable treatment method or a drug combination. World hunger could be a thing of the past. With
                        speculations about Quantum 3D printers that can churn out food from thin air, it can finally
                        achieve
                        what the world has failed to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum cryptography offers the ultimate cyber protection. Leveraging the unpredictability of
                        the
                        quantum states, it’s possible to encrypt data in its most secure form making it virtually
                        unhackable. It was no wonder that rumors of a breakthrough in this technology by China created a
                        buzz among the big powers in the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There always is one goal of humanity that seems the most unreachable and unrealistic. Since we
                        are
                        in the business of speculation, we might as well consider it. Immortality. The preservation of
                        species for all perpetuity. A concept that just blows our minds. Quantum diagnostic devices can
                        eventually enable us to correct flaws in our DNA which can then be used to reverse aging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With such mind-boggling ideas churning around it, it’s no wonder that the research into the
                        field of
                        quantum physics/computing is gaining momentum. Tipped to be “the next big thing”, the
                        opportunities
                        here are quite limitless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting from Fujitsu Quantum Devices in 1991 to several others till date we’ve taken
                        significant
                        steps to unleash its full potential. The big tech has now invested itself into it. Google’s
                        Quantum
                        AI labs, Microsoft Q station, IBM’s Quantum research team, D -Wave Systems INC and not to
                        mention
                        several other research teams and labs across the world are working in full swing to make the
                        impossible possible. With Google recently announcing their achievement of “Quantum Supremacy”,
                        it’s
                        evident that the development is gaining traction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From where we stand now, it’s not possible to predict what the quantum future really means to
                        us.
                        The entire concept is hidden behind the huge cloud of uncertainty, which ironically is one of
                        the
                        fundamental phenomena that govern the quantum world. But, it’s no coincidence that every major
                        sci-fi fantasy movie resorts to quantum tech to explain the impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we are to ascend to a world of greatness, and have the remotest chance to clear up the mess
                        we’ve
                        gotten ourselves into, Quantum technology seems the only possible way. However, it’s going to be
                        a
                        while before we can actually say “Beam me up, Scotty” and get instantly transported to our
                        docked
                        Starship and go on adventures using Quantum warp drives.
