                    <p>Alibaba’s fashion AI store in Hong Kong recently grabbed the newspaper headlines because of its
                        use of artificial intelligence to streamline the fashion retail experience. Consider a store
                        with smart mirrors that show you all the details about the garments you’ve chosen. In a usual
                        store, you stay clueless, wondering where to go to find a blazer. Alibaba Fashion AI displays
                        you a “you are here” type of map that can direct you to certain items in the store. How easy
                        life would be with this!</p>
                    <p>
                        The Alibaba Fashion Store is equipped with intelligent garment tags which sense if the garment
                        is touched and smart mirrors which display garment details and give suggestions to customers.
                        The crux of the whole wonder is AI marketing, which uses AI technologies to make automated
                        decisions based on data collection, analysis, and other economic trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though people nowadays actively hear and talk about artificial intelligence as a
                        technological wonder, few try to fully understand the concept and its nuances. The “AI Marketing
                        Era,” as it may be appropriately labeled, entails fundamental changes to the manner in which
                        marketers interact with customers, the tactics and tools they use to achieve their goals,the
                        skills they regard highly in the workplace, and the nature of their day-to-day responsibilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AI in marketing enables a host of capabilities that improve the ability of marketers to first
                        understand their customers on a comprehensive, individual level, and then create and distribute
                        content that is personalized and relevant to them at the right time and place. Brands of the AI
                        Marketing Era can stage highly customized experiences with their customers in real-time to
                        delight them and form long-lasting relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through smarter data intake and management using AI, marketers can achieve insights into their
                        customers that reveal a much more comprehensive view of their behavior, interests, needs, and
                        wants. These profound insights can then be paired with AI-powered omnichannel strategies that
                        allow marketers to reach customers where, when, and how they would like to see advertisements
                        contextualized in a way that cookies could not achieve.
                    </p>

                    <p>Further integration of AI in programmes offers solutions to many of the issues faced by
                        marketers. For one, AI allows for improved pattern recognition, insights into the sentiment and
                        context of a website’s content, and predictive analysis that can guide advertisers into making
                        smarter partnership decisions. These capabilities are crucial in fighting brand safety and
                        advertisement fraud issues.</p>
                    <p>By targeting customers based on their history with a brand’s website activity, previous marketing
                        efforts, search engine query history, or geographical location, marketers can create highly
                        detailed segments. AI can optimize retargeting advertising frequency. Machine learning
                        algorithms can accommodate the ideal number of exposures to an advertisement that customers
                        receive to provide more of what retargeting advertisements are good for while avoiding an
                        annoyance level.</p>

                    <p><strong>AI will not be automating creative job roles soon, but it does offer solutions to many of
                            the pain points related to creativity in marketing.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        For marketers, AI can augment creativity. The romanticized view of creativity being a gift
                        reserved only for peculiar artists who never run out of inspiration is not factual. The reality
                        is that creative endeavors are filled with repetitive tasks to execute properly, as well as a
                        taxing mental burden that can lead to burnout or creative fatigue. AI will not be automating
                        creative job roles soon, but it does offer solutions to many of the pain points related to
                        creativity in marketing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Large and small brands alike stand to benefit from localizing their marketing efforts using
                        AI.AI-powered chatbots (text-based conversational applications that let a human user talk with a
                        bot that replies automatically to them and which are available for customers to access 24/7)
                        Utilize Natural Language Processing to understand what a user is saying, then respond like a
                        human.Furthermore, purchases can be made directly through eCommerce chatbots as well. Having an
                        intelligent technology like this that is capable of communicating with customers in a human-like
                        manner opens many opportunities for marketers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Businesses can now have robots and specialized systems perform many tasks, which decreases the
                        amount of human resources required at any given time. Also, this reduces the need for
                        complicated equipment that constantly needs repair and maintenance. As a result, operations
                        become much more efficient and less costly to run, which benefits businesses on all levels.</p>
                    <p>Actualizing their potential requires the inevitable next step of AI. However, blindly adopting AI
                        will yield poor results if no goals, plans, or systems are in place to ensure success. Firms
                        seeking high-involvement AI solutions will need to customize their systems to meet their needs,
                        and having a clear end-goal will allow this to happen. High involvement AI solutions are not
                        plug-and-play; they require considerable effort to enable their full potential to be actualized
                        day-to-day.</p>
                    <p>Thus, humanized technology places the onus on humans to actualize its potential. Advanced AI that
                        is easily accessible to marketers is not useful if they do not know how to use it as a tool to
                        galvanize their ideas. Similarly, the quality of ideas that marketers use AI to automate
                        arguments which can become the critical differentiating factor in the era of AI marketing. AI is
                        currently nowhere close to being able to replicate the creative abilities of humans. It is up to
                        us to provide it with the direction and ideas to create impactful experiences and deliver the
                        fantastic results of which it is capable. Emphasizing the development of creative thinking
                        skills,metacognition, and improving the ability to create frameworks to engage with the world
                        can allow marketers to hone in on their innately human qualities that will deliver value using
                        AI.</p>
