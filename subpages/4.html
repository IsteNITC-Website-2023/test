                        “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
                        the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        -The Brundtland Report, 1987.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sustainable development, as a concept, came into being at the start of the 20th century. Over
                        the years, it made its way into textbooks, conferences, environmental summits, vision, and
                        mission of institutional ventures and developed into an overarching paradigm of the United
                        Nations - Sustainable Development Goals 2030. Needless to say, we as a global community have not
                        yet realized the need, depth, and span of a sustainable lifestyle, even at the expense of a
                        human-borne global pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the exponential impact of our actions is important. Binge-watching Netflix for
                        four hours per day over a month produces 53 kg carbon dioxide equivalent, i.e, an hour of
                        quality video streaming needs 7 gigabytes of energy equivalent to 445 g carbon dioxide. Studies
                        claim that an average person produces 4 tons of carbon per year globally. Coupled with the
                        industrial release, we are looking into a future that is at least 4 to 5 degrees hotter by the
                        end of this century.

                    <p>
                        While sustainability can be divided into environmental, economic, and socio-cultural sections,
                        sustainable living encompasses the entire idea by scaling it down to an individual level. We can
                        either wait for governments to ban plastics, Elon Musk to colonize Mars or make a decision to
                        individually contribute to this global need of fixing the planet. Practicing sustainability does
                        not require luxury, unlike what marketing baits today claim. Such practices are more economical
                        but require patience and perseverance to inculcate down to our daily schedules.

                        Practicing minimalism is one way of ensuring that everything we own is used to its maximum
                        potential. You may not be in a position to install solar panels, but you can do your part by
                        making use of daylight or replacing CFL tubes with LED bulbs. Be that person who regularly
                        filters your mails and virtual storage space to reduce energy consumption for data storage. Make
                        it a practice to unplug electronic devices when not in use. Just switching off may not ensure
                        electricity is not drawn unwantedly. Additions to your wardrobe can also be made from thrift
                        stores and eco-friendly clothing. Veganism is not an absolute necessity for sustainability, but
                        you can do your part by reducing your fish, poultry, and meat consumption. Buying a Tesla is not
                        always affordable, but taking a walk or using a bicycle whenever possible is a check. Do the
                        simple task of covering the utensil while cooking, and voila! You have saved 25% of your total
                        energy usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We often undermine the power of small actions in making a big impact. The opposite is proved by
                        the Dabba system workers in Mumbai who encouraged people to put a share sticker on their
                        tiffins. This helped redistribute leftover food to the needy, transforming it from sixteen tons
                        of food waste per day to zero food waste institution. You practise sustainability even by
                        supporting ventures that promote it. Using the ECOSIA search engine can make you plant trees
                        equivalent to your number of searches indirectly. Set your plans taking into consideration
                        living in harmony with the planet. Many of the dos and don’ts are cliches but of impeccable
                        relevance in this century.
                    </p>
                    <p>


                        If 7.674 billion sustainabilists are born, we are exponentially closer to revitalizing the earth
                        to its authenticity. Concern for the environment is not just something activists should have but
                        everyone who are using its resources. Unshakable commitment to sustainability is not just buying
                        eco but choosing to do more good than less harm every single day. After all, one step at a time
                        is the first change you can make.
