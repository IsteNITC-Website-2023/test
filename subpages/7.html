                    <p>
                        At the conclusion of a recent Intelligence Squared Asia debate on whether “Money Can’t Buy
                        Happiness” the audience was split - 49% agreed and 49% disagreed, with 2% undecided. But when it
                        came to travel, there was one very obvious winning premise - being on the road brings us all
                        joy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the real voyage of discovery, it is not about trying to discover new landscapes, but about
                        having new eyes. People who’ve been bitten by the travel bug will tell you how exploring the
                        world leads to bliss. Now, there’s some scientific evidence to support those anecdotes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not necessarily, experts say. Here’s what to understand about the relationship between travel
                        and happiness, along with some ways you can reap some of the psychological benefits of taking a
                        vacation when you’re on a tight budget or stuck at home. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced most
                        people to stay at home, canceling and postponing trips they had planned for 2020 and early 2021.
                        But prior to the pandemic, increasing levels of wealth disparity meant that many people couldn’t
                        afford to take a vacation.
                    </p>
                    <p>


                        As a result of widespread job losses and the economic ramifications of this pandemic, many
                        people may find it difficult to travel, even after traveling becomes safe again. That doesn’t
                        mean people who can’t travel are doomed to lower life satisfaction. In a weird way, that’s a
                        silver lining of the pandemic as it has forced us to look for simpler things that can help bring
                        happiness. People are realizing there are simpler ways to achieve happiness. It is not natural
                        for us to be this sedentary. Travel is in our genes. For most of the time our species has
                        existed, “we’ve lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers moving about in small bands”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What This Means For You?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it might seem like people who can’t afford to take a vacation can’t benefit from
                        traveling, the truth is that you may be able to achieve these benefits in other ways—something
                        that’s especially important while many people are still stuck at home during the pandemic.

                        Taking a virtual tour of a foreign destination could satiate
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking a virtual tour of a foreign destination could satiate wanderlust. You may also be able to
                        reduce stress by spending time in nature close to home when traveling isn’t an option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most valuable aspects of travel is how it broadens your horizons. Most people have
                        had that feeling of visiting a country for the first time, and being excited and enthralled by
                        everything that surrounds them. By immersing yourself in a different culture, you have endless
                        opportunities to learn new things. These could be physical skills such as mountaineering or
                        pottery, or more academic pursuits such as a second language – either way, these novel
                        experiences offer an instant mood boost. It is also a fantastic way to keep your brain active,
                        which is hugely beneficial for your cognitive powers too!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neuroscientists explain that travel rewires our brains because new experiences are core to
                        building new neural pathways in the brain. You don’t necessarily need to hop on an airplane and
                        immerse yourself in a different culture to enhance your happiness. For most people, a flurry of
                        destinations, lodgings and travel experiences flood the mind. Your brain quickly processes and
                        imagines the views you’ll see, the food you’ll savor, and the climate you’ll feel on your skin.
                        And just like that, you’ve given yourself a spark of happiness.
                    </p>
                    <p>


                        On top of that, the anticipation of a future trip, even if it’s months away, literally improves
                        our chemical makeup. It delivers a delicious dose of feel-good dopamine, which the Coleman
                        Institute calls the “anticipation molecule”. It’s obvious that travel comes with a myriad of
                        health benefits for the mind, body and soul, so what are you waiting for – it’s time to book
                        that holiday. Your health will thank you for it!
